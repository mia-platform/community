## How Can I Contribute

### Discussion Board

The [discussion board](https://github.com/mia-platform/community/discussions) is the place where you can search for common problems/ideas and ask your own; each discussion should be properly labelled, formatted and written following the guidelines below:

- all threads must be written in English
- each thread *must not* contain any reserved information (customer names, identifiers, personal data, secret values, etc)
#### Create a new discussion

Before creating a new discussion make sure there is no discussion on the same topic, already; if you didn't found what you are looking for, open a new one and make sure to properly label it.
#### Answer a discussion
