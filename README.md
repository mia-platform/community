# About this space

The Mia-Platform community is an open space for everyone using our products; any question, information or feedback is welcome so feel free to join us!

If you have any doubt where to start make sure you have read the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines][contributing].

# Mia-Platform Documentation

If you wish to go solo and learn everything by yourself, you can find all the information you need inside [Mia-Platform Documentation][mia-docs].

# Mia-Platform Marketplace

[Mia-Platform Marketplace][mia-marketplace] is the place where you can find everything you need to in order to speed up the development of your application! 

From open source code templates to full-fledged microservices, you can customize the Marketplace with your own components: follow [the official documentation][mia-marketplace-docs] to know how to do so.

We suggest to adopt a [declarative approach][mia-marketplace-declarative-approach] to handle your Marketplace, by using the official Mia-Platform CLI [`miactl`][miactl-docs].
